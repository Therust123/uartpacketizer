Ways to increase the maxm operating frequency
1)We can implement one hot coding or grey coding for state encoding instead of binary encoding
2)There us too much of if else statement in the uart transmitting block , we can pipeline that 
3)The flow of input data is like fifo to fsm to transmitter we can directly feed the data from fifo to transmitter , but logics needs to be in place.
